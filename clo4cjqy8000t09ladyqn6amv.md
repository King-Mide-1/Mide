As a member of the [Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/) community, I had the opportunity to take part in a writing challenge. In partnership with [Commerce Layer](https://commercelayer.io/), the challenge was simple. Build a project or craft an article about [Commerce Layer](https://commercelayer.io/). So I decided to take on both tasks by building and also writing a tutorial about what I have built.

The goal was to teach readers how to build a headless e-commerce website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio).

### **Simplifying the Process:**

One of the biggest challenges was simplifying the technical jargon. Many of the terms were intimidating for beginners. So, I started by explaining every step in plain language. For instance, when I talked about **headless e-commerce,** I compared it to building an online store like playing with Lego blocks. Each Lego block represents a different part of the store, which makes it easier to understand.

### **Visual Aids:**

To make the tutorial more accessible, I used images and screenshots. A picture can speak a thousand words. And it's especially helpful when explaining technical configurations. For example, I used images to show how to set up the dev environment, create an organization, and configure environment variables. These visual aids helped enhance the clarity of the tutorial.

### **Real-World Context:**

To make the tutorial engaging, I provided real-world examples. I explained that [Commerce Layer](https://commercelayer.io/) is like the engine of an online store, making it work well. While [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/studio) is like the control panel, helping users manage the store's content. This way, readers could relate these technical components to something familiar.

### **Collaborative Effort:**

Being part of [Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/) made this challenge less stressful. The community manager's support was invaluable. We discussed the best approach, and she also went ahead to provide reviews and feedback. This collaborative effort helped improve the quality of the tutorial.

### **Empowering Others:**

The most rewarding part of this tutorial was the opportunity to empower others. The tutorial aimed to break down the barriers that often make coding seem intimidating. I wanted readers to feel that they could build an e-commerce website without hassle.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this challenge was more than a technical writing task. It was a mission to empower developers. Writing this tutorial was a rewarding experience. I had to make hard ideas easier, use pictures, connect them to real life, and work with an amazing group of tech writers. Together, we made tech more accessible, one word at a time.
