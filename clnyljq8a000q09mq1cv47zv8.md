The internet is a vital tool for information and communication in our world today. Yet, people with visual impairments face unique challenges online. It's important to learn about their experiences. Because this will help us create an inclusive online environment.

### **Visual Impairment in Numbers:**

The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) reported that **2.2 billion** people have vision impairments. Additionally, another 1 billion people have untreated visual disabilities ([see report](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment)). These numbers remind us how important it is to make the internet easy for everyone to use.

### **Accessibility Gaps:**

Existing research also spots a gap in web accessibility. [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) did a study using the [WAVE stand-alone API.](https://wave.webaim.org/standalone) They found that only **59.5%** of home pages of **1,000,000** websites met basic accessibility standards([see report here](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)). This will no doubt leave users with disabilities frustrated when browsing such websites.

### **Assistive Technologies:**

Users with visual disabilities rely on aiding tools. These include screen readers and braille displays. These tools help convert text and images into hearable or touchable forms. Using these tools with clarity is important for a great web experience.

**Challenges:**

* **Unlabeled Images:** A lot of websites don't describe images with text. This makes images hard for screen readers to understand.
    
* **Complex Layouts:** Complicated website designs can be tricky for screen readers to understand.
    
* **Dynamic Content:** Sites that update a lot, can be hard to keep up with and can affect how information flows.
    

**Way Forward:**

To make the internet more open for users with vision problems, we need to take a good approach:

* Governments and organizations need to follow accessibility standards like [ATAG2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) and [WCAG.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
    
* Train designers and developers to create accessible content.
    
* Involve folks with vision issues in making and testing. It ensures that everyone can use the product.
    
* We should continue making assistive tools better. This will make using the web easier and more correct.
    

To sum up, the internet is a powerful tool. But we can make it even better when everyone can use it. Helping people who can't see well is essential. It's not about being nice; it's the law in many areas. We can make things better by solving problems and creating designs for everyone. This way, everyone can use the internet with ease.
